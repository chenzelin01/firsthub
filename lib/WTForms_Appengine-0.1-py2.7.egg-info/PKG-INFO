        WTForms-Appengine
        =================
        
        WTForms-Appengine is a fork of the ``wtforms.ext.appengine`` package 
        from WTForms. The package has been renamed to ``wtforms_appengine`` 
        but otherwise should function the same as the ext package, at least
        for the moment.
        
        to install::
        	
        	pip install WTForms-Appengine
        
        
        Rationale
        ---------
        
        The reasoning for splitting out this package is that WTForms 2.0 has
        deprecated all its ``wtforms.ext.<library>`` packages and they will
        not receive any further feature updates. The authors feel that packages
        for companion libraries work better with their own release schedule and
        the ability to diverge more from WTForms.
        
        This package is currently looking for a permanent maintainer, and if you 
        wish to maintain this package please contact ``wtforms@simplecodes.com``.
